        tomatoes range in size from a thumbtip to the size of a golf ball. Their shape
        ranges from spherical to slightly oblong to pointed at the bottom. They are
        often red, but can also be yellow, green, striped, and even black. More oblong
        cherry tomatoes often share characteristics with plum tomatoes, and are known
        as grape tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes can be quite sweet (such as the Sungold
        or Sunsweet yellow varieties), more traditionally acidic, or deep in flavor.
        They are delicious for snacking, in salads, lightly roasted or grilled, or
        baked. They require little to no pruning unlike larger tomato plants.","slug":"cherry-tomato","created_at":"2020-04-16T16:24:38.778Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T16:24:38.778Z"},{"id":76,"name":"brandywine
