        tomato is the fruit of the tomato plant, a member of the Nightshade family
        (Solanaceae). The fruit grows on a sprawling vine that is often trellised
        or caged to keep it upright. There are many kinds of tomatoes, including conventional,
        hybrid, heirloom, plum, grape, and cherry. Determinate or bush varieties do
        not need pruning and can be grown without trellises or cages. Indeterminate
        or climbing varieties benefit from pruning and should be trellised, caged,
        or staked.","sun":"Full Sun","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5dc3618ef2c1020004f936e4.jpg?1573085580","height":90,"spread":60,"sowing":"Direct
